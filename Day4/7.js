// 7. Create a local text file that contains words in it. Using JavaScript read the words
// from a text file and create a recursive function that identifies the very first item
// that has recurred in the word. It returns the identified item with the index where it
// first appeared and the very next index where it reappeared - entirely as an object.
// Ex.first word from file - “BTEJHBERSD” ➞ {“E”: [2, 6]}
//    2nd word from file - “JPDETRETXD” ➞ {“E”: [3, 6]}
//    … and go on.
